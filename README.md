starting out with coding 

Hello Cyberworld!

Andru here,

I'm not in my natural habitat here on GitHub, nevertheless im currently actively pursuing a life affirming new interest. As a lifetime consummer of technology I've decided to have a 'look under the hood' and see if i can eventually turn my hand to a bit of coding. 

It would be nice to think I might retain enough from my various explorations to maybe build a REALLY simple app for iOS?!

So this is my firt simple (yet manageable step!). Watch this space!!
