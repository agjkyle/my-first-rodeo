starting out with coding 

Hello Cyberworld!

Andru here,

I'm not in my natural habita here on GitHub, nevertheless im currently actively pursuing a life affirming new interest. A lifelong consummer of technology and have decided to hace a 'look under the hood' amd see if i can eventually turn my hand to a bit of coding. 

It would be nice to think I might retain enough from my various explorations to maybe build a REALLY simple app for iOS?!

So this is my firt simppe (yet manageable step!). Watch this space!!
